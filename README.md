# Tactile UX
A guide for designing tactile user experiences

</div>

<br><br>

Tactile UX denotes user experience where state of interactivity of various elements is clearly and consistently communicated to the user. It is intended for contexts where a combination of interactive and non-interactive elements are present. Following these guides ensures that users can quickly and efficiently determine the state of interactivity of the UI with minimum error (error is when a user misses an interactive element, or where they mistake a non-interactive element for an interactive element).

ðŸ‘‰ Tactile UX is **NOT** for contexts where most elements are interactive. It focuses on clear and explicit signaling of interactivity, which leads to visual clutter in contexts where most elements are interactive. Specifically, it is **NOT** to be used for designing input widgets (such as onscreen keyboards on smartphones, etc.).

## Overview

Tactile UX aims to increase usability of interfaces with a combination of interactive and non-interactive elements. It helps users quickly understand what can they do with a particular interface and what they might be able to do. This is achieved by defining [five degrees of interactivity](/degrees-of-interactivity.md) that apply to ALL visual elements, and requiring [_consistent_](/clarity-and-consistency.md#consistency), [_clear_](/clarity-and-consistency.md#clarity) and [linear](/linearity.md) visual indicators for each degree of interactivity.
