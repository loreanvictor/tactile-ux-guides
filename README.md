# Tactile UX
A guide for designing tactile user experiences

</div>

<br><br>

Tactile UX denotes user experience where state of interactivity of various elements is clearly and consistently communicated to the user in a linear manner. It is intended for contexts where a combination of interactive and non-interactive elements are present. Following these guides ensures that users can quickly and efficiently determine the state of interactivity of the UI with minimum error (error is when a user misses an interactive element, or where they mistake a non-interactive element for an interactive element).

ðŸ‘‰ Tactile UX is **NOT** a design system. It is a set of recommendations for creating design systems that lead to tactile user experience. Figures used across these documents **SHALL NOT** be interpreted as a design system of their own. They merely present shots of how various solutions to design constraints presented by current guides might look like. They are intentionally inconsistent in their design language to highlight possibility of multiple varying solutions.

ðŸ‘‰ Tactile UX is **NOT** for contexts where most elements are interactive. It focuses on clear and explicit signaling of interactivity, which leads to visual clutter in contexts where most elements are interactive. Specifically, it is **NOT** to be used for designing input widgets (such as onscreen keyboards on smartphones, etc.).

## Overview

Tactile UX aims to increase usability of interfaces with a combination of interactive and non-interactive elements. It helps users quickly understand what can they do with a particular interface and what they might be able to do.

The core idea of Tactile UX is the [five degrees of interactivity](/degrees-of-interactivity.md) that apply to ALL visual elements. A particular design (or design system) is _tactile_ (or provides _tactile UX_) if it provides [_consistent_](/clarity-and-consistency.md#consistency), [_clear_](/clarity-and-consistency.md#clarity) and [linear](/linearity.md) visual indicators for each of these degrees of interactivity.
