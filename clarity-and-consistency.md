# Clarity & Consistency

</div>

<br><br>

Adjectives [clear](#clarity) (also used as _clarity_) and [consistent](#consistency) (also used as _consistency_) are recurringly used in this guide in reference
to visual signals, cues, design approaches, etc. Both concepts are vague, subjective and open to interpretation, nevertheless here some baseline definitions
are offered to provide some insight about the intent behind their use in these documents.

<br><br>

# Clarity

A visual signal is _clear_ if it is easily noticeable in a quick glance. A clear visual signal is not mistaken for another, and it is hard to miss. Clarity is subjective and open to interpretation, and differs based on context. For example, sufficient degree of clarity differs greatly based on age-range and/or professional background of target users.

    Example: lines under inputs can get mistaken with line dividers and vice versa, which reduces clarity.

# Consistency

A particular piece of information is communicated by visual cues in a _consistent_ manner, when the very same design rules are utilized to communicate said information. For example, interactive elements are communicated consistently by a _blue left border_ when all interactive elements have a blue left border and other visual element that has a blue left border is also interactive.

    Example: buttons are interactive because of their background while inputs are interactive because of the line under them. This leads to increased inconsistency.
