# Clarity & Consistency

</div>

<br><br>

Adjectives [clear](#clarity) (also used as _clarity_) and [consistent](#consistency) (also used as _consistency_) are recurringly used in this guide in reference
to visual signals, cues, design approaches, etc. Both concepts are vague, subjective and open to interpretation, nevertheless here some baseline definitions
are offered to provide some insight about the intent behind their use in these documents.

<br><br>

# Clarity

A visual signal is _clear_ if it is easily noticeable in a quick glance. A clear visual signal is not mistaken for another, and it is hard to miss. Clarity is subjective and open to interpretation, and differs based on context. For example, sufficient degree of clarity differs greatly based on age-range and/or professional background of target users.

# Consistency

A particular piece of information is communicated by visual cues in a _consistent_ manner, when the very same design rules are utilized to communicate said information. For example, interactive elements are communicated consistently by a _blue left border_ when all interactive elements have a blue left border and other visual element that has a blue left border is also interactive.

Consistency **SHOULD** be required / applied with awareness of context. The goal of consistency is to increase learnability and memorability: for example is interactivity is only communicated by _blue left borders_, then users need to learn (and recall) one rule: _blue left borders mean interactivity_. If multiple inconsistent rules are used, the amount of rules the user should learn (and recall) will increase, which negatively affects learnability / memorability. That said, prior familiarity greatly affects that: for example a lot of users are already familiar with a _checkbox_ and expect it to be interactive regardless of existence of a blue left border, so consistency in this case can be applied with a more relaxed approach.
