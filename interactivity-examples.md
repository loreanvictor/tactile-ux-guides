# Interactivity Examples

</div>

<br><br>

Here are a few practical examples of visual elements and the [degree of interactivity](/degrees-of-interactivity) assignable to them. Visual elements
**MUST** [clearly](/clarity-and-consistency#clarity) and [consistently](/clarity-and-consistency#consistency) communicate the degree of interactivity
that is attributed to them.

## Buttons

ğŸ‘‰ A button is in _Interactive_ state.

ğŸ‘‰ A disabled button is in _Disabled_ state.

ğŸ‘‰ A button, while being pressed, is in _Standby_ state.

Explanation: A button that is being pressed does not have any further possible interaction, but releasing the mouse key (or user finger) will cause
it to have more interactions again.

ğŸ‘‰ A button that is hovered can be in _Reaching Out_ state.

ğŸ‘‰ A button that will take the user to the next application stage can be in _Reaching Out_ state.

## Inputs

ğŸ‘‰ An input is in _Standby_ state.

Explanation: Inputs have _focus_/_blur_ interactions available at all times. However this is not the main interaction of the input. The main interaction,
for example, is done through keyboard input, so the input element is _Interactive_ only when keyboard input directly interacts with it.

ğŸ‘‰ A focused input is in _Interactive_ state.

ğŸ‘‰ An input that requires user attention (for example due to validation error) is in _Reaching Out_ state.
